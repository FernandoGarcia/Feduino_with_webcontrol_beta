## About

This project is based on the [Arduino] platform.

This project started from the need to make partial water changes automatics in my 3 tanks.
After accomplishing what I wanted, the project has grown to the point it’s today.

The code was written based on version 2.1 of [Stilo].

All work was done thanks to the people who devote their time sharing their knowledge on forums.

Therefore, this is completely Open Source and always will be.
